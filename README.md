## **Salary Prediction Data Science Project**

This repository contains two Jupyter Notebooks for predicting the salary and satisfaction level of data-related positions based on location, company reviews, and job titles.

## **Salary_Prediction.ipynb**

This notebook aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the salary of data-related positions. The model will be trained on a dataset of job postings that includes information on location, company reviews, job title, and salary. The goal is to provide a tool to help data professionals understand their worth and negotiate better salaries.

The model uses **linear regression**, which is a statistical method that models the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. The goal of linear regression is to predict the value of one variable (the dependent variable) given the value of another variable (the independent variable).

### Dependencies

To run this notebook, you will need to have the following dependencies installed:

* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* scikit-learn

### Installation

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

### Execution

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can run the notebook by opening it in Jupyter Notebook and clicking the `Run` button.

## **Salary_Prediction_classification_all.ipynb**

This notebook aims to predict whether the salary for data-related positions, based on location, company reviews, and job title, is satisfactory or not. The model uses three machine learning algorithms: logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest.

* **Logistic regression** is a statistical method that models the probability of a binary outcome (e.g., satisfactory or not satisfactory) given a set of independent variables (e.g., location, company reviews, job title).

* **Decision tree** is a tree-like structure that represents a set of decisions and their possible consequences. It is a non-parametric model, meaning that it does not make any assumptions about the underlying data.

* **Random forest** is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to create a more accurate and robust model.

### Dependencies

To run this notebook, you will need to have the following dependencies installed:

* pandas
* NumPy
* matplotlib
* scikit-learn

### Installation

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

### Execution

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can run the notebook by opening it in Jupyter Notebook and clicking the `Run` button.
