## **Project Overview**

In this project, we develop a machine learning model to predict salaries for data-related positions. The goal is to provide a tool to help data professionals understand their worth and negotiate better salaries. The project utilizes various data science techniques and algorithms to analyze the dataset and make accurate salary predictions.

## **Dataset**

The dataset used in this project contains information about job titles, salary estimates, ratings, company names, locations, and other relevant features. The dataset was preprocessed and cleaned to remove instances without salary estimates and hourly salaries. The cleaned dataset was then used for further analysis and modeling.

**Installation**

To run this project locally, you need to follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/sagharganji/Salary_Prediction_Project.git
2. Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
**Usage**

To use the salary prediction model, you can follow these steps:
1.Load the trained model: model = pickle.load(open('Salary_Estimater.pkl', 'rb'))
2. Prepare input data: Provide the necessary input features such as job title, rating, and state.
3.Make salary predictions: predictions = model.predict(input_data)

## **Modeling**

The machine learning model used for salary prediction is based on [LinearRegression]. It has been trained on the provided dataset to learn the relationships between the input features and the target variable (salary).

## **Results**

The trained model achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of X, indicating its effectiveness in predicting salaries for data-related positions. The results can be further analyzed and visualized to gain insights into salary trends and factors influencing salary predictions.
